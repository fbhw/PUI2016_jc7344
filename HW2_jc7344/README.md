##Homework 2

#Assignment 1

I worked closely with Nonie Mathur, Laura Gladson, Felipe Diego Gonzalez and Alexey Kalinin on creating a notebook on Jupyter. Alexey was crucial in creating the actual code from Jupyter instead of doing it from Terminal. 

Kristin Korsberg helped us troubleshoot our code for the cases in which we had 0 number of buses in a specific bus line. 

#Assignment 2

Kristin Korsberg, Nonie Mathur and Laura Gladson shared valuable observations on the coding for the bus next location. We used information compiled within the Python boot camp information on PUI2016 to stablish a variable that replaced “0” by “N/A”.

#Assignment 3

Laura Gladson, Adriano Yoshi, Nonie Mathur and Kristen Korsberg were instrumental for downloading the data from CUSP data hub and then plotting the graphics.

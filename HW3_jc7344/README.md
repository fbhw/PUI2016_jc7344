### Homework 3

## Assigment 1

For this assignment I worked closely with Nonie Mathur, Maisha Ahsan, Laura Gladson and Alexey Kalinin. We used the instructions from Prof. Bianco's repository in order to complete the first distribution. Howverer, we used instructions from scipy.org for the rest. We encounter several errors when attempting to find the means for the rest of the distributions (normal, poisson, Gauchy. Binomial)

## Assigment 2 

For this assignment Nonie Mathur, Laura Gladson,  were intrumental for constructing a solid Hypothesis and analysing Citibike data.

## Assignment 3

For this assignment I worked closely with Nonie Mathur. Her instructions were key throughout the whole process.

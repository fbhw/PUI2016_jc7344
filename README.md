#Assignment 2
For this part of the homework we were required to create an environmental variable and push it from the local branch to the Github PUI2016_jc7344/ HW1_jc7344 repository.

After receiving instructions from Daniel Fay, I worked closely with Nonie Mathur and Laura Gladson on how to create an invironmental virable both from compute (using nano .bashrc) and on my local machine (using nano .bash_profile). After finishing this portion of the assignment, Laura Gladson helped create the PUI2016_jc7344/ HW1_jc7344 repository on Github. I also received great help from TA Saubreen Syedmajeed in updating my github credentials.
